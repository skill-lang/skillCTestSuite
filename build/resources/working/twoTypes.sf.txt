Distributes two types with an instance each over two blocks.
This can be used to ensure that type indices are created correctly in the context of multiple blocks.

The file will fail to parse, if the type index is interpreted on a per block basis.

Types:
Block1: a{a a;}
Block2: b{b b;}

Instances:
Block1:
a{→self}

Block2:
b{→self}
